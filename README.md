# Convert UFO glyph files (`.glif`) to SVG

There exists already an `svg2glif`, but for some reason not the opposite operation. My MFEKglif editor treats `.glif` files as first-class entities, so it seemed obvious to me I'd want to edit them with Inkscape, etc sometimes.

I originally wrote this in Python ([ctrlcctrlv/glif2svg](https://github.com/ctrlcctrlv/glif2svg)) but it was too slow for the huge amount I was using it in FRBAmericanCursive's build. So, I ported it to Rust. Also, I decided to make it part of the MFEK suite of programs, since it heavily relies on MFEK libaries like glifparser and mfek-ipc.

Convert between glif to SVG

USAGE:
    glif2svg [FLAGS] [OPTIONS] <input>

FLAGS:
    -h, --help            Prints help information
    -M, --no-metrics      Don't consider glif's height/width when writing SVG, use minx/maxx/miny/maxy
    -T, --no-transform    Don't put transform="translate(…)" in SVG
    -V, --version         Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -o, --output <output_file>    The path to the output file. If not provided, or `-`, stdout.
                                  
                                  
    -F, --fontinfo <fontinfo>     fontinfo file (for metrics, should point to fontinfo.plist path)
                                  

ARGS:
    <input>    The path to the input file.
```

## Requirements

This is a normal Rust build; however the final binary will expect you to have [MFEKmetadata](https://github.com/MFEK/metadata) in your path as well.
